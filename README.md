For Homework 6.

I have annotated my two Jupyter notebooks along the way for reference.

Based on the findings I got from Part I, these are my conclusions:

1. Max temperature tends to be much higher for cities with latitudes close to 0 than it is for cities with latitudes far from 0. It's not a perfect correlation, but it's noticeable enough.
2. Humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed have virtually no correlation based on latitude.
3. There were way more cities found in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere, probably because excluding Antarctica, far less of the latter hemisphere is covered in land.
